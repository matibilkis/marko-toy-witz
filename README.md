I have to solve a challenge to source data from yahoo finance and apply Markowitz mean-variance optimization to a portfolio of ten assets.

I hold a PhD in physics and i'm good at problem solving, but we assume i have no clue on anything from finance not portfolio optimization.

You will be the expert consulting at both the optimization, finance and overall technicalities. I will ask very concise questions and work on this with claude-code on my local repo.

Please provide very short answers. Do not assume I am right. Do not exaggerate and look for classical asnwers in the literature that are well established.
